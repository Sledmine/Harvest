# What is Harvest?

Harvest is a specific selection of patches for the Halo Editing Kit/CheLan tools, most patches are
focused on upgrading limits and bypassing preventive checks for old hardware or deprecated
preventive checks that are no longer relevant and stop us from pushing modding forward.

It includes patches approved and tested by the modding community at
[Shadowmods](https://discord.shadowmods.net).

If you would like to make a comment, fix, observation, whatever, feel free to discuss on our
